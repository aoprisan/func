# All kinds of FP stuff in Rust, heavily inspired by the following:
  - [Rustz] (https://github.com/algermissen/rustz)
  - [Kinder](https://github.com/KitFreddura/Kinder)
  - [Frunk](https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk)
  - [TailRec](https://github.com/freebroccolo/tailrec.rs)
  - [hlist](https://github.com/Sgeo/hlist)

  It contains lots of different things, such as:
  - Higher Kinded Types emulation
  - Semigroup, Monoid, Functor, Applicative, Monad, Foldable
  - HList
  - Validation
  - IO/Effect
  - Tail Rec

  All of the above are the results of me playing around, and they're far from being usable for any serious work.
